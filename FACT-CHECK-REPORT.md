## 2. French Bulldog Summer Safety Guide

### ✅ VERIFIED
- Heatstroke is a leading cause of preventable death in brachycephalic breeds
- Frenchies have stenotic nares, elongated soft palate, smaller trachea
- Dogs cool primarily through panting (evaporative cooling)
- Heatstroke can cause kidney failure, brain swelling, organ damage
- Most Frenchies can't swim due to heavy front end and short legs
- Blueberries and watermelon are dog-safe fruits
- 5-second pavement test for paw safety

### ⚠️ UNVERIFIED
- Temperature guidelines table (specific thresholds like 22-24°C moderate risk) — reasonable but not from a single authoritative source; varies by individual dog
- Frenchies start struggling at 22-24°C — directionally correct for brachycephalic breeds

### ❌ INCORRECT — FIXED
- **"Do NOT use ice water — it causes blood vessels to constrict on the surface, trapping heat inside the body. Cool water is more effective."**
  - **Reality:** This is an outdated myth. Recent peer-reviewed veterinary research (Royal Veterinary College, 2023; published in PMC) has conclusively shown that cold water immersion is the gold standard for treating heatstroke in dogs. The vasoconstriction concern was never supported by evidence and has been debunked. The colder the water, the faster and more effective the cooling.
