Bringing home a French Bulldog puppy is one of the most exciting things you'll ever do. It's also slightly terrifying, because these little potatoes come with more specific needs than most people expect. 

When I brought George home, I thought I was prepared. I was not. I spent the first week frantically ordering things I didn't know I needed while George chewed on things he definitely shouldn't have.

This guide is everything I wish someone had told me before day one. Consider it your complete French Bulldog puppy shopping list, organized by priority.

## The Essentials (Get These Before Puppy Comes Home)

### Food & Water

**Puppy food:** Start with whatever the breeder was feeding. Transition gradually to your chosen brand over 7-10 days. For Frenchie-specific recommendations, see our [Best Food for French Bulldogs](/reviews/best-food-for-french-bulldogs/) guide.

- [Royal Canin French Bulldog Puppy](https://www.amazon.de/s?k=Royal+Canin+French+Bulldog+Puppy&tag=focushack-21, breed-specific kibble shape and nutrition
- Small kibble matters. Frenchie puppies have flat faces and tiny mouths

**Slow feeder bowl:** Non-negotiable for Frenchies. They inhale food, causing bloating, gas, and vomiting. A slow feeder extends mealtime from 30 seconds to 5-10 minutes.

👉 [Slow feeder bowls on Amazon.de](https://www.amazon.de/s?k=slow+feeder+dog+bowl+small&tag=focushack-21)

**Water bowl:** Stainless steel or ceramic (not plastic. Plastic can cause chin acne in Frenchies). Low-profile design so their flat face can reach the water easily.

👉 [Stainless steel dog bowls on Amazon.de](https://www.amazon.de/s?k=stainless+steel+dog+bowl+small&tag=focushack-21)

### Sleeping

**Puppy bed:** Something washable, affordable, and cozy. Don't invest in an expensive orthopedic bed yet. Puppies destroy things, and they'll outgrow it.

- A simple bolster bed with a washable cover is perfect
- Size: Small/Medium for a Frenchie puppy
- Place it in your bedroom initially. Frenchie puppies DO NOT do well alone at night

👉 [Puppy beds on Amazon.de](https://www.amazon.de/s?k=puppy+bed+small+washable&tag=focushack-21)

**Crate:** Crate training is highly recommended for Frenchie puppies. It gives them a safe den, helps with housetraining, and prevents destructive chewing when unsupervised.

- Size: Medium (they need room to stand, turn, and lie down, but not so much that they can use one end as a toilet)
- Wire crates with a divider panel are ideal, you can adjust the space as they grow
- Add a soft blanket and a cover to make it den-like

👉 [Dog crates with divider on Amazon.de](https://www.amazon.de/s?k=dog+crate+medium+divider&tag=focushack-21)

### Walking Gear

**Harness:** Always a harness, never a collar, for walking. Frenchie puppies pull, and any neck pressure is dangerous for brachycephalic breeds.

- Start with an adjustable puppy harness, they grow fast
- Graduate to a proper harness once they reach adult size (around 9-12 months)

👉 [Puppy harness adjustable on Amazon.de](https://www.amazon.de/s?k=puppy+harness+adjustable+small&tag=focushack-21)

For adult harness recommendations, see our [Best Harnesses for French Bulldogs](/reviews/best-harnesses-for-french-bulldogs/) guide.

**Leash:** A standard 1.5-2m leash is best. Avoid retractable leashes. They teach puppies to pull and don't give you enough control.

**ID tag:** Even before microchipping, put an ID tag on their collar with your phone number. Puppies are escape artists.

**Poop bags:** You'll go through hundreds. Buy in bulk.

👉 [Biodegradable poop bags on Amazon.de](https://www.amazon.de/s?k=biodegradable+dog+poop+bags&tag=focushack-21)

### Safety & Puppy-Proofing

**Baby gates:** Block off stairs and rooms you don't want the puppy in. Frenchie puppies should avoid stairs. Their joints are developing and their clumsy build makes falls likely.

👉 [Baby gates for dogs on Amazon.de](https://www.amazon.de/s?k=baby+gate+dog+stairs&tag=focushack-21)

**Puppy pen/playpen:** A contained area where the puppy can play safely when you can't supervise directly.

**Cord covers:** Frenchie puppies chew everything. Electrical cords are genuinely dangerous.

**Remove/secure:**
- Toxic plants (lilies, ivy, aloe vera, many others)
- Small objects that could be swallowed
- Shoes, socks, underwear (Frenchie puppies LOVE these)
- Cleaning products and chemicals
- Medications

## Health & Grooming Essentials

### Veterinary

**Find a vet BEFORE the puppy arrives.** Ideally one experienced with brachycephalic breeds. Book the first appointment for within 48-72 hours of bringing puppy home.

**First vet visit checklist:**
- General health assessment
- Vaccination schedule review
- Parasite check (worms, fleas)
- Microchipping (if not done by breeder)
- Discuss spaying/neutering timeline
- Ask about breed-specific health screening

**Pet insurance:** Get it immediately. French Bulldogs have expensive health needs. The sooner you insure, the fewer pre-existing condition exclusions you'll face.

### Grooming Supplies

**Wrinkle wipes:** You'll be cleaning face folds from day one. Fragrance-free baby wipes or dedicated dog wrinkle wipes.

👉 [Dog wrinkle wipes on Amazon.de](https://www.amazon.de/s?k=dog+wrinkle+wipes+french+bulldog&tag=focushack-21)

For a complete wrinkle care routine, see our [How to Clean French Bulldog Wrinkles](/guides/how-to-clean-french-bulldog-wrinkles/) guide.

**Puppy shampoo:** Gentle, fragrance-free, designed for sensitive skin. See our [Best Shampoos for French Bulldogs](/reviews/best-french-bulldog-shampoo/) guide.

**Nail clippers:** Start trimming nails early so they get used to it. Guillotine-style or grinder, whichever your puppy tolerates better.

👉 [Dog nail clippers on Amazon.de](https://www.amazon.de/s?k=dog+nail+clippers+small&tag=focushack-21)

**Soft brush:** Frenchies don't need heavy grooming, but weekly brushing removes loose hair and distributes natural oils. A rubber grooming mitt works great.

👉 [Rubber dog grooming mitt on Amazon.de](https://www.amazon.de/s?k=rubber+dog+grooming+mitt&tag=focushack-21)

**Ear cleaner:** Frenchies are prone to ear infections. Weekly ear cleaning prevents buildup.

👉 [Dog ear cleaner on Amazon.de](https://www.amazon.de/s?k=dog+ear+cleaner+gentle&tag=focushack-21)

**Dental supplies:** Start dental care early. Puppy toothbrush and enzymatic toothpaste.

## Toys & Entertainment

**Chew toys:** Frenchie puppies need to chew. Give them appropriate options or they'll chew your furniture.

Essential starter toys:
- **KONG Puppy** (softer rubber than the Classic). Stuff with puppy food or peanut butter.
- **Nylabone Puppy Chew.** Textured for teething relief
- **Rope toy** (for supervised tug only, don't leave unattended)

👉 [KONG Puppy toy on Amazon.de](https://www.amazon.de/s?k=KONG+Puppy+toy+small&tag=focushack-21)

**Teething toys:** Puppies teethe from about 3-6 months. Provide cold/frozen toys for relief.

**Puzzle toys:** Start mental stimulation early. Simple puzzle feeders and snuffle mats are perfect for puppies.

👉 [Snuffle mat for dogs on Amazon.de](https://www.amazon.de/s?k=snuffle+mat+dog&tag=focushack-21)

For more toy recommendations, see our [Best Toys for French Bulldogs](/reviews/best-french-bulldog-toys/) guide.

## Training Essentials

**Training treats:** Small, soft, high-value treats. Puppies have tiny stomachs, so treats should be small (pea-sized or smaller).

**Treat pouch:** Clip to your belt for easy access during training sessions.

**Enzymatic cleaner:** Accidents will happen. Enzymatic cleaners break down the smell so the puppy doesn't return to the same spot.

👉 [Enzymatic pet cleaner on Amazon.de](https://www.amazon.de/s?k=enzymatic+pet+stain+cleaner&tag=focushack-21)

**Puppy pads:** For the first few weeks of housetraining. Place near the door and gradually move outside.

## Budget Estimate

Here's roughly what the essentials cost:

| Category | Estimated Cost |
|----------|---------------|
| Food (first month) | €20-40 |
| Bowls (slow feeder + water) | €15-25 |
| Bed + crate | €50-80 |
| Harness + leash + ID tag | €25-40 |
| Safety (gates, puppy pen) | €30-60 |
| Grooming basics | €25-40 |
| Toys (starter set) | €25-35 |
| Training supplies | €15-25 |
| First vet visit | €50-100 |
| Pet insurance (monthly) | €30-60/month |
| **Total (first month)** | **€285-505** |

This doesn't include the puppy itself (which, for a well-bred Frenchie from a reputable breeder, is typically €2,000-4,000+). Budget accordingly.

## First Night Tips

The first night is the hardest. Your new Frenchie puppy has just left their mother and siblings, and they will cry. Here's how to survive it:

1. **Put the crate next to your bed.** Your presence is comforting. They can hear and smell you.
2. **Include a warm water bottle** (wrapped in a towel). Mimics body heat of littermates.
3. **A ticking clock** nearby can be soothing (mimics heartbeat).
4. **Don't give in to crying** by taking them into your bed. This sets a precedent. But DO comfort them with a calm voice.
5. **Take them out for a bathroom break** once during the night (puppies can't hold it all night).
6. **Expect 2-3 rough nights.** It gets better, I promise.

## Common Mistakes New Frenchie Owners Make

1. **Skipping pet insurance.** French Bulldogs are expensive to treat. One surgery can cost €3,000-8,000.
2. **Using a collar for walks.** Always a harness for brachycephalic breeds.
3. **Over-exercising.** Puppies need rest. The rule of thumb is 5 minutes of exercise per month of age, twice a day.
4. **Ignoring wrinkle care.** Start cleaning folds from day one. Infections are easier to prevent than treat.
5. **Not socializing.** The socialization window (3-14 weeks) is critical. Expose your puppy to different people, sounds, surfaces, and experiences.
