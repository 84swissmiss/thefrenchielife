## Hey there 👋

I'm Annie — the human behind The Frenchie Life — and George is the four-legged boss who runs the show.

When I first brought George home — a snoring, snorting, impossibly cute French Bulldog puppy — I did what every new dog owner does: I Googled everything. "Best dog harness." "Best puppy food." "Best dog bed."

And you know what I found? Generic "best dog product" lists that recommended the same stuff for a Chihuahua as for a Great Dane. Not a single mention of flat-face-friendly designs, sensitive skin formulas, or the fact that Frenchies overheat if you look at them wrong on a warm day.

**French Bulldogs are not regular dogs.** I say that with love. They're wonderful, hilarious, stubborn little creatures — but they have very specific needs:

- **Brachycephalic airways** — They can't breathe well in heat, with tight collars, or during heavy exercise
- **Sensitive skin** — Allergies, hot spots, and fold infections are basically a Frenchie rite of passage
- **Joint issues** — Their compact, muscular build puts stress on joints, especially as they age
- **Pulling power** — Don't let the small size fool you. George pulls like a sled dog when he spots a pigeon
- **Temperature sensitivity** — They overheat in summer and freeze in winter. High maintenance? Maybe. Worth it? Absolutely.

## What We Do Here

Every product on this site has been tested on George (or thoroughly researched with input from other Frenchie owners and vets). I don't do sponsored reviews. I don't accept free products in exchange for positive coverage. If something is trash, I'll say so.

**My affiliate disclosure:** Some links on this site are affiliate links. If you buy something through them, I earn a small commission at no extra cost to you. This helps keep the site running and George in treats. I only recommend products I genuinely believe are good for French Bulldogs.

## Meet George 🐶

George is a gray French Bulldog with an opinion about everything and a talent for strategic napping. He's the chief product tester at The Frenchie Life. His qualifications include:

- **5-star snorer** — Can be heard from two rooms away
- **Professional treat negotiator** — Will sit, shake, and spin for a single dental chew
- **Harness escape artist** — Has tested the durability of every harness on this site (involuntarily)
- **Heat sensitivity expert** — Will dramatically flop on the floor if the room is above 22°C

## Why Trust Us?

I'm not a vet. I'm not a dog trainer. I'm a Frenchie owner who got frustrated with bad recommendations and decided to do something about it. Every article on this site is based on:

1. **Real testing** — George uses these products in daily life
2. **Community feedback** — Input from Frenchie owner communities and forums
3. **Vet guidance** — Health-related recommendations are cross-referenced with veterinary sources
4. **Honest opinions** — If a "bestseller" doesn't work for Frenchies, I'll tell you why
